Create you scripts according to the Folder Structure here:
Teleopti.Ccc.AnalysisServicesManager\Custom\Umniah

============
01 Datasource
============
Hardcoded filename!
01 Datasource\DatasourceViewDefinition.xml
Follow the xml structure in the Umniah example

Note, you must first create you SQL Server relational tables in order to deploy the corresponding AS datasource view

============
02 Dimensions
============
All *.xmla files will be added to the ASDatabase

Important!
Dimensions are create at two levels in AS
- AS Database
- AS Cube

The Database.Dimension(s) are handle via .xmla files in the folder;
BUT - The Cube.Dimension lack that kind of xmla-support!
Instead AMO is used to add the Cube.Dimension.
The name used for the Cube.Dimension will be equal to the dimension filename, without extension.

eg. "02 Dimensions\Survey Score.xmla" will describe the Database.Dimension
<DimensionID>Survey Score</DimensionID>
<Name>Survey Score</Name> 

The "Name" will be used for the Cube.Dimension as "CubeDimensionID":
<CubeDimensionID>Survey Score</CubeDimensionID>
And that ID will be referenced later by *.xmla files in "03 Measures"

============
03 Measures
============
All *.xmla files will be added to the ASDatabase

============
04 Other
============
All *.xmla files will be added to the ASDatabase
