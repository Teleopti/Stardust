Feature: Team schedule sorting
	In order to easily find who is working at a specific time
	As a team leader
	I want to get the persons sorted in order of the schedules
	
Background:
	Given there is a team with
	| Field | Value      |
	| Name  | Team green |
	And there is a role with
	| Field                      | Value               |
	| Name                       | Anywhere Team Green |
	| Access to team             | Team green          |
	| Access to Anywhere         | true                |
	| View unpublished schedules | true                |
	And 'Ashley Andeen' has a person period with
	| Field      | Value      |
	| Team       | Team green |
	| Start date | 2013-09-26 |
	And 'Pierre Baldi' has a person period with
	| Field      | Value      |
	| Team       | Team green |
	| Start date | 2013-09-26 |
	And there are shift categories
	| Name  |
	| Day   |	
	And there is an activity with
	| Field | Value |
	| Name  | Phone |
	| Color | Green |
	And there is an absence with
	| Field | Value    |
	| Name  | Vacation |
	| Color | Red      |
	And there is a dayoff with
    | Field | Value   |
