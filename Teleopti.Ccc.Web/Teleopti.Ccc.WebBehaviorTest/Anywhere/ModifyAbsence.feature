Feature: Modify absence
	In order to keep track of persons absences
	As a team leader
	I need to be able to record that an agent has returned to work before the end date/time of an absence

Background:
	Given there is a team with
	| Field | Value            |
	| Name  | Team green       |
	And I have a role with
	| Field                      | Value               |
	| Name                       | Anywhere Team Green |
	| Access to team             | Team green          |
	| Access to Anywhere         | true                |
	| View unpublished schedules | true                |
	And 'Pierre Baldi' has a person period with
	| Field      | Value      |
	| Team       | Team green |
	| Start date | 2013-03-01 |
	And there is a shift category with
    | Field | Value |
    | Name  | Day   |
    | Color | Green |
	And there is an activity with
	| Field | Value |
	| Name  | Phone |
	| Color | Green |
	And there is an absence with
	| Field | Value    |
	| Name  | Vacation |
	| Color | Red      |
	And there is an absence with
	| Field | Value   |
	| Name  | Illness |
	| Color | Gray    |
