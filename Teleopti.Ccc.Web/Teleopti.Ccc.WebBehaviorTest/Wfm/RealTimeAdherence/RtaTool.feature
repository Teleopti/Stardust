@RTA

Feature: Rta tool
	In order to manually verify the rta works
	As a tester
	I want to see that the agent view updates when I send in states
	
Background:
	Given there is a switch
	And there is an activity named 'Phone'
	And there is a site named 'Paris'
	And there is a team named 'Red' on site 'Paris'
	And I have a role with
	 | Field                | Value |
	 | Access to everything | true  |
	 | Access to team       | Red   |
	
	And Pierre Baldi has a person period with
	 | Field          | Value        |
	 | Team           | Red          |
	 | Start Date     | 2017-01-01   |
	And there is a state with name 'Ready'
	
Scenario: See agent update in agents view
	Given the time is '2017-05-22 08:00'
	And I am viewing the rta tool
	When I send 'Ready' for all agents
	And I view real time adherence for all agents on team 'Red'
	Then I should see agent 'Pierre Baldi' with state 'Ready'
