Feature: See historical adherence for 7 days back
  As an adherence analyst I need to see all OoA occurrences and the exact reason why for up to 7 days back,
  so that I have solid proof when I talk to team leads and agents about bad adherence.

  Background:
	Given there is a switch
	And there is an activity named 'Phone'
	And there is a site named 'Hammersmith'
	And there is a team named 'Motorhead' on site 'Hammersmith'
	And I have a role with full access
	And Mikkey Dee has a person period with
	  | Field      | Value      |
	  | Team       | Motorhead  |
	  | Start Date | 2014-01-21 |
	And there is a rule named 'Adhering' with
	  | Field       | Value |
	  | Activity    | Phone |
	  | Phone state | Ready |
	  | Adherence   | In    |
	And there is a rule named 'Not adhering' with
	  | Field       | Value     |
	  | Activity    | Phone     |
	  | Phone state | LoggedOff |
	  | Adherence   | Out       |
