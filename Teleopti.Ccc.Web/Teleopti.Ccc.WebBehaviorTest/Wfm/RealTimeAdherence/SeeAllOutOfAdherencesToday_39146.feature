Feature: See all out of adherences for today
	so that I can act upon it eventhough I was in a meeting when it happened and was obviously not looking at the screen,
	so that I free up time and don't have to look at the screen all day,
	so that I can act on OoA today not only shortly after it occured.
	As a real time analyst
	I need to see all OoA that has happened today for one agent
