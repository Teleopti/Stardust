Feature: Pause button
	In order to have time to analyze current situation
	As a real time analyst
	I want to be able to pause screen updates
	...So I can be interupted without losing context
	...So I can take screenshots

Background:
	Given there is a switch
	And there is an activity named 'Phone'
	And there is a site named 'Paris'
	And there is a team named 'Red' on site 'Paris'
	And I have a role with full access
	And Pierre Baldi has a person period with
	 | Field      | Value      |
	 | Team       | Red        |
	 | Start Date | 2016-05-19 |
	And Pierre Baldi has a shift with
	| Field                    | Value            |
	| Activity                 | Phone            |
	| Start time               | 2016-05-20 08:00 |
	| End time                 | 2016-05-20 17:00 |
	And there is a rule with 
	| Field       | Value |
	| Activity    | Phone |
	| Phone state | Ready |
	And there is a rule with 
	| Field       | Value     |
	| Activity    | Phone     |
	| Phone state | LoggedOut |

Scenario: Pause
	Given the time is '2016-05-20 08:00:00'
	And 'Pierre Baldi' sets his phone state to 'Ready'
	When I view real time adherence for all agents on team 'Red'
	Then I should see 'Pierre Baldi' in state 'Ready'
	When I pause screen updates
	And 'Pierre Baldi' sets his phone state to 'LoggedOut'
	And I wait 10 seconds
	Then I should see 'Pierre Baldi' in state 'Ready'
