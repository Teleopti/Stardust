Feature: Adherence percentage
	In order to ...
	As a real time analyst
	I want to see ...
	
Background:
	Given there is a switch

Scenario: See adherence percentage from agent state overview
	Given there is an activity named 'Phone'
	And there is a site named 'Paris'
	And there is a team named 'Red' on site 'Paris'
	And I have a role with full access
	And Pierre Baldi has a person period with
	 | Field          | Value        |
	 | Team           | Red          |
	 | Start Date     | 2014-10-06   |
	And Pierre Baldi has a shift with
	| Field      | Value            |
	| Start time | 2014-10-06 08:00 |
	| End time   | 2014-10-06 10:00 |
	| Activity   | Phone            |
	And there is a rule with 
	| Field       | Value    |
	| Adherence   | In       |
	| Activity    | Phone    |
	| Phone state | Ready    |
	And there is a rule with 
	| Field       | Value        |
	| Adherence   | Out          |
	| Activity    | Phone        |
	| Phone state | Pause        |
	When the time is '2014-10-06 08:00:01'
	And 'Pierre Baldi' sets his phone state to 'Ready'
	And the time is '2014-10-06 09:00:01'
	And 'Pierre Baldi' sets his phone state to 'Pause'
	And the time is '2014-10-06 11:00:00'
	And I view historical adherence for 'Pierre Baldi'
	Then I should see adherence percentage of 50%
