Scenario: Can add intraday absence to agent in another time zone
	Given 'John Smith' has a shift with
	| Field          | Value            |
	| Shift category | Day              |
	| Activity       | Phone            |
	| StartTime      | 2017-04-17 09:00 |
	| EndTime        | 2017-04-17 17:00 |
	And 'Bill Gates' has a shift with
	| Field            | Value            |
	| Shift category   | Day              |
	| Activity         | Phone            |
	| StartTime        | 2017-04-17 10:00 |
	| EndTime          | 2017-04-17 17:00 |
	When I view wfm team schedules
	And I set schedule date to '2017-04-17'
	And I searched schedule with keyword 'Team green'
	And I click button to search for schedules
	And I selected agent 'Bill Gates'
	And I open menu in team schedule
	And I click menu item 'AddAbsence' in team schedule
	And I set a new absence as
	| Field        | Value            |
	| Absence      | Vacation         |
	| SelectedDate | 2017-04-17       |
	| StartTime    | 2017-04-17 21:00 |
	| EndTime      | 2017-04-17 22:00 |
	| FullDay      | False            |
	Then I should be able to apply my new absence
	When I apply the new absence
	Then I should see a successful notice
