Feature: AgentGroup
	As a resource planner 
	I need to generate a plan (schedule&opt) for my part of the organization,
		so that Stockholm can be planned by 4-weeks and Paris by monthly periods,
		so that I can plan for Customer Support and Lisa can plan for Sales,
		so that John can plan for Invoice in London,
		so that Fixed agents in London have exactly 2 DOs off per week.
