	And there is a skill named 'TheSkill1' with activity 'TheActivity1'
	And there is queue statistics for 'Queue1'
	And there is a workload 'TheWorkload1' with skill 'TheSkill1' and queue 'Queue1'


Scenario: Forecast all
	Given there is a workload 'TheWorkload2' with skill 'TheSkill1' and queue 'Queue1'
	And there is no forecast data
	When I am viewing forecast page
	And I use default forecast period and forecast for all
	And Forecast has succeeded
	Then there is forecast data for default period for 'TheWorkload1'
	And there is forecast data for default period for 'TheWorkload2'

@ignore
Scenario: Forecast one workload
	Given there is a workload 'TheWorkload2' with skill 'TheSkill1' and queue 'Queue1'
	And there is no forecast data
	When I am viewing forecast page
	And I select workload 'TheWorkload2'
	And I use default forecast period and forecast for one workload
	And Forecast has succeeded
	Then there is forecast data for default period for 'TheWorkload2'
	And there is no forecast data for default period for 'TheWorkload1'
	
Scenario: Add campaign

	And I select to modify the forecast
	And I choose to add a campaign
	And I increase the calls by 100 percent
