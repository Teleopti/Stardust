Getting started

Database
To run the application you must have a set of databases. Run ".debug-Setup\Restore to local.bat" to restore a matching set of databases and make sure the configuration is correct.

Open solution
The CruiseControl.sln is the solution containing all the projects needed to build all parts of Teleopti WFM.

To be able to build the Windows application client you will have to install Syncfusion Essential Studio of the correct version. An alternative is to apply the BuildServerSetup.reg file found in \\a380\hangaren\#PROGRAM\Develop\Syncfusion\BuildServer. Please note that you cannot open any form containing Syncfusion controls in edit mode with only the build server setup.

Starting the client
To run the web applications you set the Teleopti.Ccc.Web as a Startup project and run the solution. If you need backend processing to be running, please start the Teleopti.Ccc.Sdk.ServiceBus.ConsoleHost project manually using the context menu "Debug" > "Start new instance".

To run the Windows application client, set Teleopti.Ccc.SmartClientPortal.Shell project as startup project and run the solution.
