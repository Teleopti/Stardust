	/// <summary>
	/// <para>Command for adding a schedule changes listener</para>
	/// <para>The schedule changes will arrive as POST data to the endpoint you specify through the SDK.</para>
	/// <para>The function to get information about current subscriptions and listener endpoints is <see cref="GetScheduleChangesSubscriptionSettingsQueryDto"/> on the SchedulingService.</para>
	/// <para>The response on this function also contains the details needed to verify the signature of the incoming data.</para>
	/// <para>To add a new listener the command <see cref="AddScheduleChangesListenerCommandDto"/> should be executed.</para>
	/// <para>The url needs to be an absolute url (the complete address with http or https included) to the endpoint.</para>
	/// <para>DaysStartFromCurrentDate and DaysEndFromCurrentDate creates a filter on the range of schedule changes to listen for. A value of -1 for DaysStartFromCurrentDate means that changes from yesterday are included and a value of 1 for DaysEndFromCurrentDate means that changes for tomorrow are included. Please note that these dates are local dates in the viewpoint of the agents. DaysStartFromCurrentDate must be smaller than or equal to DaysEndFromCurrentDate.</para>
	/// <para>The name must be provided and will be used when the endpoint should be removed using the <see cref="RevokeScheduleChangesListenerCommandDto"/> command.</para>
	/// <para>The schedule data sent from Teleopti WFM is formatted as json.</para>
	/// <para>In the http request there will be a header named Signature with a base64 encoded signature value. That signature can be used to verify the contents of the request body. Use the public key exposed in the SDK mentioned before in combination with the signature. The hashing algorithm used is SHA1. If the request body cannot be verified with the signature someone has tampered with the contents and the request should be discarded.</para>
	/// <para>Only schedule information for the default scenario gets sent to the listener. You might get ScheduleDays outside your predefined filter, so always make sure you filter the schedule days on the recieving side as well.</para>
	/// <para>The content of the messages will contain the following information:</para>
