WARNING
===================
Do NOT run this tool in a live environment!
It will cause a _very_ heavy load on your I/O disk subsystem!!!


Use SQLIO to test disk performance of a SQL Server BEFORE MSSQL is installed,
or before any load is put on it.
SQLIO will simulate SQL Server by doing writes and reads to ONE specified disk.

Usage:
- Put all files on the disk you want to measure (or only the .dat file but then ou need to modify param.txt)
- Start StartSQLIO.bat
- Wait
- Wait
- Look at result.txt

The result is presented as (sample from 5-ear old physical server at Teleopti):

Look at raw throuput MB/s, and perhaps more importantly average latency. Sometimes latency is very spread out and ou may look at the histogram for that.

It will test writes and reads in multiple ways. We tpically want to see average latency consistently under 20ms for both reads and writes.
