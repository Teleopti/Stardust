IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sys.columns WHERE object_id=OBJECT_ID('dbo.StateGroupActivityAlarm','U') AND name='IsDeleted')
	BEGIN
		EXECUTE('DELETE FROM dbo.StateGroupActivityAlarm WHERE IsDeleted=1')
	END
GO

IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sys.columns WHERE object_id=OBJECT_ID('dbo.StateGroupActivityAlarm','U') AND name='IsDeleted')
	BEGIN
		ALTER TABLE dbo.StateGroupActivityAlarm	DROP COLUMN IsDeleted
	END
	
GO

	insert into PurgeSetting values ('Message', 10)
end
